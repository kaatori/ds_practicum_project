## Note to the Reader:  This file is for the Data 642 Adv ML class, not for the practicum of Data 793. 
- In Data 793, the classification modeling was for CLade C with Ridge, Lasso, and tree methods. Please refer to the 'analysis' main list of files for Data 793 work related to **Clade C (278 rows of Clade C v non-Clade C).** The balanced 278-row dataset for this was created in 'Experimental Logistic Regression Clade C.Rmd' and the **final modeling** is revised and confirmed in 'Ridge_Lasso_Modeling_Revised.Rmd' and 'Tree_Methods_Clade_C.Rmd'. 

### The folder 'data_642_jupyter_notwbooks' is work related to *only* that course, Fall 2023. 
- This extra work in Data 642 is included in this directory because of the batch density plots in Python created for viewing the densities of Clades A and C as they were used in the final presentation for Data 793, but only for visualization purposes of the two primary clades in the coral data. 
- The Data 642 work will be different in nature and not related to client requests; however, permission was granted by the client to use the coral data for the projects associated with both courses (Data 793 and Data 642).

## Read in Data
```{r}
read_csv("../output/rev_coral_join.csv") -> rev_coral_join
```

- The above import of data has 778 rows because some samples have sequencing counts for more than one Clade. 


## Subset Clade C as it's the minority
- Clade A is the majority
- Clade D, G and B only have 1 or 2 rows; therefore, need to focus on Clade A or Clade C. 
```{r}

# Extract the minority class samples (139 observations)
minority_class_C <- rev_coral_join[rev_coral_join$Clade == 'C', ] # 139

# Extract the majority class samples (the rest of the dataset)
majority_class_A <- rev_coral_join[rev_coral_join$Clade == 'A', ] # 628

######### Percent Clade C v Clade A
139/(139 + 628)
```

- 18 % is not bad for the minority class, so since it's better to go with more data, we will keep Clade A with over 600 samples so that we can model it better. Clade C was already modeled (see 'Ridge & Lasso Modeling.Rmd') but Clade A will be modeled in python for Data 642 project. 

```{r}

# Combine the datasets
AC_df <- rbind(majority_class_A, minority_class_C)

# Shuffle the rows to randomize the order
AC_df <- AC_df[sample(nrow(AC_df)), ]

```

```{r}
dim(AC_df) # 767 x 5897
head(AC_df)
```
