# ds_practicum_project

Data Science Practicum Project for completion of the MS in Data Science, expected December 2023

This project explores the application of machine learning methods for analyzing coral algae and bacteria relationships, including Principal Components Analysis, K-Means, and classification algorithms. Traditional bioinformatics methods are well-documented, such as the R libraries of 'phyloseq', 'vegan', and many others. The application of machine learning methods is novel in the coral microbiome research community. The scope of this project involves an exploration of how machine learning methods may be applied; therefore, the focus is to understand the application and usage of the above-mentioned methods on data collected under the March 2023 publication. 

Note: Some function calls take a very long time to run, namely the K-means clustering in the files referencing "coseq".
